## Changes from the accepted version of the paper

* de-anonymized the paper by replacing instances of "our version of Verus" with "Verus";

* added URLs for the open source Verus project and the open source case studies in the Introduction;

* added hardware information for the Node Replication experiment in section 4.2.2;

* updated the Verus-mimalloc line counts in section 2.4.2 and in Figure 8; the lines of code were incorrectly undercounted by about 200 lines in the accepted version of the paper and this has now been rectified.
